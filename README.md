basic express server for saving online articles to read later.

### To do

- [x] basic API
  - [x] add an article
  - [x] RSS endpoint so you can sync it with your feed aggregator of choice
  - [ ] delete an article?
- [x] get configuration from environment variables
- [x] add a database (stored as JSON but i would like to use sqlite3. i just have no idea what i'm doing.)
- [ ] add docker support
- [ ] make a browser bookmarklet for quickly saving articles
- [ ] log some useful info on startup, like the bookmarklet code
- [ ] find a slightly better name

### Will not do

- make a frontend. i'm keeping it simple, why not fork it and add one yourself? ðŸ˜‰
