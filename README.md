  - [x] RSS endpoint so you can sync it with your feed aggregator of choice
  - [ ] delete an article?
- [ ] add a database (sqlite, probably)
- [ ] make a browser bookmarklet for quickly saving articles
- [ ] log some useful info on startup, like the bookmarklet code
- [ ] find a slightly better name

### Will not do

- make a frontend. i'm keeping it simple, why not fork it and add one yourself? ðŸ˜‰
