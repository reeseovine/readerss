basic express server for saving online articles to read later.

### To do

- [x] a basic API so you can save articles with a web browser bookmarklet
- [x] an RSS endpoint so you can sync it with your feed aggregator of choice
- [ ] add a database (sqlite, probably)

### Will not do

- no frontend, i'm keeping it simple. why not make one yourself? ðŸ˜‰
